content: How we're using AI wrong

AI is for executing, but never for thinking.

Your problems are unique, a LLM are great at things it has seen thousands of times.

Any project will have problems. And any project will have problems that are unique and you cannot know about.

An LLM can’t evaluate your solution, it can’t think. It can’t balance trade-offs. 

The only thing that it can do is to generate text. Nothing more.
